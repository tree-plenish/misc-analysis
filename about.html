        <p id = "bioTxt">Hello! I'm Joy, and I'm a first-year engineering student at Columbia. I'm interested in applied math and computer science, and how they can be used to address/solve social problems. Outside of academics, I love running long distances, drinking coffee, writing, and coding (for fun)! At Columbia, I am currently taking Data Structures in Java, Multivariable Calculus, and Accelerated Physics. I am also involved in various Christian ministries. I am on the blog team for the Columbia Witness, which is the Christian publication on campus, and I'm on the board for the Veritas Forum, where we host discussions on life's greatest philosophical and moral questions. I am also in the Engineers without Borders Ghana Tech Team. </p>
